# MHWildsMonsterDatabase

***WORK IN PROGRESS***

This is a tool meant to show the hitzone values of monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds in a clean and intuitive way.

## How to Use
Not yet implemented, will eventually become a website.

## How to Run Locally
Clone the repository.
If the monster data is out of date, run `web-scraper/web_scraper.py`.\
To launch the website, run `npm install`, then `ng serve`. 
Once the server is running, the page can be found at `http://localhost:4200/`
